Inbots - Global Game Jam 2018

You are the bot in your inbox, managing incoming messages. Packet switched transmissions come in constantly and need to be routed correctly. To keep your inbox clear, pick up the packets, and place them in the correct pneumatic tube. Be sure not to let unwanted messages pile up!

InBots is a Global Game Jam 2018 submission. You can build it in Unity by downloading the Git Repo from Github.

To play, use the arrow keys to move the robot. The space bar picks up the boxes. This is your life now.
